<h3> Daly College</h3>
<div>
	
<img src="daly clg.jpg" height="300px" width="300px">Each school has its own ethos, traditions and identity. Parents should understand and evaluate this aspect, as your children will be influenced by what we stand for. No compromise will be made in our basic beliefs, to satisfy the individual and varied requirements of parents. We believe that all students are equal and must make their own mark within the community. The financial or social status of the parents is irrelevant. Each student's individuality will be respected and the student will be taught to compete against himself or herself rather than against others. Good behaviour must similarly be not to impress others but because it satisfies one's own self respect.
